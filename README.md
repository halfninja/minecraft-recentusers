This is a plugin for Bukkit, the Minecraft server. It adds a command called
**/recentusers** which prints a list of the users who have most recently
joined or connected. It is mainly intended for a barely-populated server to
make it easy to see if anyone else has been on recently, or if the server's
dead.
